"info":"The game that pushed me to upgrade to a PS4 Pro. A mesmerising experience of web-slinging
around New York that flows naturally into combat, paired with an story experience that I
can only describe as - I wish my movies were as good at storytelling as my games.. My
only gripe with the game being its kind of slow gadget selection screen pulling me out
of combat some times."
