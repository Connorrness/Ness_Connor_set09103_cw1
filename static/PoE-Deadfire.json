"rate": "8/10",
"info": "Deadfire set my standards for party RPGs. A well written plot, lovable characters, actual consequences of actions, great level design, and some kick-ass voice acting. My only complaint is the shortness of most dungeons and the kinda confusing ship combat the first couple fights."
