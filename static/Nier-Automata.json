"info":"I toot Automata as my favourite game ever. A game I'll never forget. It's been a long time since I was so engaged with a game and I don't think something will ever come close for another long time. A deeply philisophical game with existential questions of humanity and the individual, paired with an extremely interesting hack-and-slash plus pseudo-3D-bullet-hell combat system, and one of the best OSTs I've ever heard in my life. Pick up this if you even have the slight bit of interest."
