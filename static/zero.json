"info":"At first glance Zero seemed like just another action set in the Fate universe. However
upon watching it immediately showed itself to be one of the most interesting character
driven shows I have ever had the extreme pleasure of viewing. Following the seven mages
and their servants in the 4th Holy Grail war, mostly focusing on the father of Stay Night's
protagonist, Emiya Kiritsugu. Renowned Mage Killer hitman hoping to win the grail in order
to save all of humanity. Pitted against Kirei Kotomine - Priest of the Holy Church with
a deeply suppressed sadistic side just waiting to burst into the world to inflict as much
agony as possible. The dichotomy between these two was done with such expertise that their
final fight had me on the edge of my seat. A prequel that exceeded its source while also
adding enough weight to the characters to improve the source on re-reads."
