"info":"Placed in the shoes of part-time student part-time Phantom Thief of Hearts you live the double life, breaking into people's minds to force them to see the evil they have committed to make them confess through their own mouths. An incredibly jazzy experience wonderfully jelling the mundane yet not uninteresting life of a student and the connections with people he meets, with the high-energy stealthing, dungeon crawling and turn based fighting of the Phantom Thieves. One of the grooviest soundtracks that I never tire of hearing, and the best story ever written by Atlus."
