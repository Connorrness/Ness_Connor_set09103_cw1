"info":"A classic grindfest finally brought to a platform that doesn't give me hand-cramps. A large number of weapon-types all being usable, interesting boss-monsters, and varied locales. A great game to play with friends or to play alone while watching Netflix. An abysmally bad story brings this game down though, I've never been so uninterested in extremely one dimensional characters."
