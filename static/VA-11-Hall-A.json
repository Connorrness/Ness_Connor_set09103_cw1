"info":"Cyberpunk - Subterfuge, Advanced Tech, Mega-Corporations, Replicants, Bartending?A world as interesting as most cyberpunks but this time you aren't playing as an all important figure to the world shaping it to your ideals, you are a bartender named Jill who is trying to pay her rent. That's it. A Visual Novel with some light gameplay in the form of mixing drinks. The perfect game for a night alone while drinking some whiskey. Some of the most well written characters I've ever seen and an atmosphere that fully draws you in. A futuristic city with an extremely sketchy corporate police force but what are you gonna do about them? Nothing. You are just a bartender. You'll chat with customers about the world around you and some personal matters with the ones you are close to but your impact on the world only extends to the people around you and the ones you care about. VA-11 Hall-A helped my world view become a lot more optimistic after playing it, I regularly  listen to its soundtrack on the way to work."
