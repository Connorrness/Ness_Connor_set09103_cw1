"info":"A complete re-imagining of the Zelda formula brings us to one of the most atmospheric open worlds
and interesting Zelda game ever made with combat and movement systems that gel so well with
what you expect to happen when you try them, combat has a mechanic where you can point your
shield downwards, do it on a hill and you'll start sliding down it as a surfboard. Don't wanna
play all of those pesky interesting quests? just leg it butt-ass naked to Ganon's castle and
fight him with whatever crap you picked up on your way there."
