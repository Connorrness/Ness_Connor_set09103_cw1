"info":"Honestly I never thought I'd like Splatoon 1, I was dead wrong. Splatoon 2 is better in every way. Hip, cool, funny. The first two I'd never describe it as unless I was currently playing the game. Traversal and combat are intertwined together, you shoot ink and travel through it. The goal? ink as much as you can on the map, another team will be doing the same, you can focus on stopping them or focus on undoing their work. An interesting take on the multiplayer shooter."
