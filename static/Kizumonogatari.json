"info":"A movie trilogy set as a prequel to Bakemonogatari. Here we see how protagonist Araragi became a half vampire, and how is friendship with Hanekawa began. With some of the flashiest and goriest fight scenes in the series and one of the most enjoyable movie series made, it is easy to see how it became known as the best of Monogatari."
