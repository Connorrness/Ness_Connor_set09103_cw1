"info":"Well known for its existance in limbo, the movie took an insane 7 years production time.
However it was definetely worth the weight. Beautifully fully frame-drawn animation gives
the bombastic sci-fi space racer an eye-glued-to-screen watching, paired with characters
who while partially lacking - give a lot more joy than would be expected."
