"rate":"6.5/10",
"info":"A mobile gacha game tied to the Fate universe, extremely interesting story as far as most gacha
games go and quite allowing with its free-to-play audience to still fully enjoy the game.
Although it does have some of the annoying elements as most mobile games, a daily stamina meter,
paid currency, and a rather quiet dev team brings down this enjoyable game."
