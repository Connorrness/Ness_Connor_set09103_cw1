<!-- fr I'm just gonna be ripping some of my MAL entries from over the years
some shit I like and some shit I don't. Probably get about 12ish entries
that look kinda like the last screen, an image that on hover fades and brings
up the description, clicking it could link to a page with like the same shit.

might make it a grid layout, 3x4 maybe?, might look nice if I make a site with
no scrolling needed, -->
