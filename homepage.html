<!-- gonna have a side navbar this time, then two central interactable
images that link to their subpages of anime and games, just to showcase
some url hierarchy i.e. x/anime/bebop or x/games/nier -->

<!-- aim to have those images fade on hover and the like, I'd also like
a textbox description to show on hover with the image being faded behind -->

<!-- maybe have a bottom navbar just for style points thinking of a colour
scheme the now, have it change for homepage/anime/games? or keep it the same?
who knows, not me, probably should think about it -->
